## Technical description

Flutter 3.3.10 â€¢ Dart 2.18.6

Dependency injection was implemented using the `get_it` package + `injectable` package (for code generation).

DI depends on the mode in which the application is running:  `dev`, `prod` or `test`. Depending on this, the possibility of using mock repositories appears.

`flutter_bloc 8.1.1` library is used for implementing BLoC pattern.

`hydrated_bloc` package was used to store the states of cubits responsible for authentication and interaction with posts.

Also for code generation of immutable classes `freezed` package was used.

`Dio` package was used as http client due to support interceptors.
