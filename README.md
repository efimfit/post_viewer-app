I guess this is the best design you've ever seen. But you need to understand that the goal of this project was anything but design ðŸ˜„

## Technical description

Flutter 3.3.10 â€¢ Dart 2.18.6

Dependency injection is implemented using the `get_it` package + `injectable` package (for code generation).

DI depends on the mode in which the application is running:  `dev`, `prod` or `test`. Depending on this, the possibility of using mock repositories appears.

`flutter_bloc 8.1.1` library is used for implementing BLoC pattern.

`hydrated_bloc` package is used to store the states of cubits responsible for authentication and interaction with posts.

Also for code generation of immutable classes `freezed` package is used.

`Dio` package is used as http client due to support interceptors.
